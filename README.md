## Introduction

The Nepal Public Grievance Management System is a state-of-the-art platform designed to streamline the submission and tracking of grievances from citizens. This platform aims to improve accountability in grievance resolution, enhance transparency, and provide a secure and efficient system for citizens to voice their concerns.

## Problem Statement

In Nepal, the existing grievance management systems are often plagued by inefficiencies, delays, and a lack of transparency. This leads to user frustration and hinders the resolution of public grievances. 

## Objectives

Our objectives for this project are:

1. **Streamline Grievance Submission and Tracking:** Simplify the process for citizens to submit their grievances and allow them to track the status of their submissions in real-time.

2. **Improve Accountability in Grievance Resolution:** Implement robust mechanisms to ensure that grievances are handled promptly, fairly, and transparently.

## Key Features

- User-friendly web-based platform for grievance submission.
- Real-time tracking of grievance status.
- Blockchain integration for transparency and security.
- Automation of grievance resolution through smart contracts.
- Data encryption and strict access control measures.

## Technology Stack
